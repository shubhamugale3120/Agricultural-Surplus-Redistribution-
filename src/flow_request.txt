 Flow of a Request
Example: Farmer adds a new crop
Farmer sends POST /api/crops with crop data.
crop.routes.js receives it â†’ sends to crop.controller.addCrop.
crop.controller.addCrop validates data â†’ calls crop.model.save().
crop.model.js interacts with DB â†’ stores crop in Mongo/SQL.
Response sent back: { message: "Crop added successfully" }.
If farmer was not logged in â†’ auth.middleware.js blocks request.
If error occurs â†’ error.middleware.js sends clean error JSON.
so in short:
server.js = main entry
routes/ = defines endpoints
controllers/ = request logic
models/ = database
middleware/ = security & error handling
config/ = DB setup
package.json & linters = project housekeeping
Client (Frontend / API consumer) â†’ Sends request (like add crop, login, get farmers).
Server.js â†’ Entry point. Sets up Express, loads middleware, connects DB, and mounts routes.
Middleware â†’ Runs before requests hit controllers. Handles authentication (auth.middleware.js) and common logic.
Routes â†’ Define the API endpoints (/crops, /farmers, /auth). Maps each HTTP request to a controller function.
Controllers â†’ Contain logic. They call models, process data, and return responses.
Models â†’ Define DB schema (Mongoose) and handle database queries.
Database (MongoDB) â†’ Stores persistent data (users, farmers, crops).
Error Handler â†’ Catches issues from anywhere (controller/middleware) and sends a proper error response back.
Response â†’ Client â†’ The client gets back JSON with success/error.
âš¡ So the flow is always:
ðŸ‘‰ Client â†’ Server.js â†’ Middleware â†’ Routes â†’ Controllers â†’ Models â†’ Database â†’ (response or error) â†’ Client
